    The root is responsible for defining the chord, so it always holds the most harmonic weight.

    On the downbeat, we’re going to play the root; and on the last beat of each bar, we’re going
    to play a chromatic approach tone leading into the next root, or it’s corresponding fifth.

    1. Take chord-progression
    2. Downbeat of each bar: root of chord.
       If there is more than one chord per bar, write in the root of the first beat the chord is introduced.
    3. Last beat of bar: Three options:
        • The fifth scale degree of the following note
        • A half step before the following note
        • A half step above the following note
    4. Fill in the blanks

	 	phr.addNote(new Note(rootPitch, C));
	 	phr.addNote(new Note(rootPitch - 2, C));
	 	phr.addNote(new Note(rootPitch - 3, C));
	 	phr.addNote(new Note(rootPitch - 5, C));
		return phr;
